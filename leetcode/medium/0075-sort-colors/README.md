# Sort Colors

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them  **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

 **Output:**  [0,0,1,1,2,2]

 **Explanation:** 

The array has two 0s, two 1s, and two 2s. Sorting them in-place places all 0s first, then all 1s, then all 2s.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [2,0,1]

 **Output:**  [0,1,2]

 **Explanation:** 

The array has one each of 0, 1, and 2, arranged in-place in the order 0, 1, 2.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 300
- nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

 

 **Follow up:**  Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

```java
class Solution {
  public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
    int l = 0;
    int r = nums.length - 1;

    for (int i = 0; i <= r;)
      if (nums[i] == 0)
        swap(nums, i++, l++);
      else if (nums[i] == 1)
        ++i;
      else
        swap(nums, i, r--);
  }

  private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
    final int temp = nums[i];
    nums[i] = nums[j];
    nums[j] = temp;
  }
}
```
